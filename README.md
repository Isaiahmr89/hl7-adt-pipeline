**Project Overview:**

This project showcases the integration and transformation of HL7 messages. I will be utilizing a simple stack in the pipelining.
Although using real patient data would not be accessible, I will have to fabricate my own and generated a mock API where
HL7 ADT messages are generated, QA'd for validation and converted into FHIR format in order to be stored in a database
for future ADT dashboard analytics use which will be implemented.

This project will be updated on a CI/CD basis meaning there will be constant updates, integrations and deployments as progression furthers.

**Tech Stack Overview:**
Python scripting (mock HL7 message creation)
Flask API (web interfacing HTTP/TCP, POST/GET operations)
PostgreSQL (relational database curated storage)
Power BI (dashboard analytics)
AWS S3 (future cloud integration and storage)
